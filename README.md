# Playtester Notice – Uncanny Cat Golf Aero Saga  

**Uncanny Cat Golf Aero Saga** is a fangame created by **Mangelrex**, based on the iconic *Uncanny Cat Golf* by **SH2K**. All credits go to SH2K for the original game.  

### Build 01 Overview:  
- **World 0: Beginner's Golf Field** – Includes 15 unique tutorial levels.  
- **World 1: Poolside Paths** – Currently incomplete, available up to level 1-3.  
- Features a **start screen** and **exit screen**.  
- Implements a **new save system** using the `.ucus` (Uncanny Cat User File) format, a hybrid between JSON and binary. This allows players to save and load progress at any time.  

### Important Notes on the Save System:  
- **Modifying `.ucus` files or attempting to load non-UCUS files is strictly prohibited.** Doing so will trigger a **blue screen error** once the system scan completes.  
- However, a **Recovery Screen** is in place to allow you to continue playing or repair corrupted `.ucus` files.  

### How to Repair `.ucus` Files:  
To fix corrupted save files, you will need the **Uncanny Cat Golf Aero Saga - UCUS Utility** tool.  

**This fangame was developed by Mangelrex, but all credit goes to SH2K for the original game.**  

**Enjoy testing, and let us know your feedback!**
